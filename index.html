     <p>My name is Alan Davalos Camacho. I was born in Mexico in Guadalajara Jalisco.
         <br>
         I live in los Angeles, California. Currently unemployed due to the Corona virus disaster.
         <br>
         I like to workout, eat good and motivate others to do the same. My dreams is to help people 
         <br>
         become the best versions of themselves. In other words i want to elevate the hurt people.

     <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a
         <br>
          page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
          <br>
           normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look 
           <br>
           like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum
           <br> 
           as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in
           <br>
           their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
